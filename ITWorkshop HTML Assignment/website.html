    Your time is limited. By the time you finish this sentence, someone will visit and abandon your
website. Unless you give your visitors a reason to stick around, they're gone. High bounce rate is an
indicator of visitors' lack of interest.

<p><h2>Here are some of the most common problems in website design:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>There's no clear path. </b>You want to extend a warm welcome to your visitors. Give them an
            easy way in and through. Too much competition for attention is a turn off. When you
            provide too many options, the functional result is no options.
            </li>
        <li><b>Outdated design.</b>Your site was state of the art in 2009. It's got a header, a couple of
            sidebars, and a big chunk of information running down the center. Guess what? It looks like
            it's nearly a decade lid. Because it is. Time to refresh with current design thinking. The
            layout of a page has evlived over the past decade. These days the best sites break up content
            into smaller, digestible bits.
        </li>
        <li><b>Overused stock images and icons. </b>If visitors see the same image on multiple sites, it erodes
            trust. That picture of people sitting around the conference table? They sure get around to a
            lot of offices!
            
            </li>
        <li><b>Too many textures and cliors. </b>You are trying to add interest, but you just add clutter. Limit
            cliors and fonts. Maintain a thematic clior scheme. For professional sites, try to limit the
            variety of fonts to three or fewer.
            </li>
        </ol>
